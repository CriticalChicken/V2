## What&rsquo;s new

[Go in-depth with our new changelog &raquo;](CHANGELOG.md)

### A bold new look

![A side-by-side comparison of V2.0 and V2.1](https://github.com/CriticalChicken/V2/assets/35422415/ef45d937-e1f2-4eab-a4fa-4704728eab9f)

Drop shadows, dynamic animations, and visually-distinct sections combine to create a new design that&rsquo;s more approachable, easier to navigate, and recognisable at a glance.

For the first time in our seven-year history, we&rsquo;re throwing open the floodgates to comments from our readers! We&rsquo;re determined to build a safe, inclusive place for people to share their opinions &ndash; without having to worry about personal attacks.

### Redesigned titleTags

![The redesigned titleTags for a variety of categories, including "E3's future" and "Rumour"](https://github.com/CriticalChicken/V2/assets/35422415/67b62f5c-d277-45a8-9da4-807f95bc0a71)

Our colour-coded titleTags appear alongside every post, making it easy to find related content.

In V2.1 we&rsquo;ve simplified titleTags, introduced new icons, and made it even easier to spot the games and topics &ndash; like **Ace&nbsp;Attorney** and **Dungeons&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Dragons** &ndash; that we&rsquo;re covering in-depth.

### ChickenFeed

![A cropped screenshot of the new ChickenFeed section](https://github.com/CriticalChicken/V2/assets/35422415/023f8dbb-d2c2-4fbc-b9bc-8d6199e61df5)

Our homepage is now home to ChickenFeed &ndash; a glanceable hub that&rsquo;s home to faux stock markets, weekly opinion polls, and &lsquo;vital&rsquo; games industry statistics.

### Redesigned Tidbyt app

ReedPop and E3 have announced a 'mutual decision' to part ways, after this year's expo was cancelled. Plus: has E3 2024 already been cancelled, too?" src="https://github.com/CriticalChicken/V2/assets/35422415/07a6c9a1-26e2-4041-8c8d-6f21a02ada98">

We&rsquo;ve completely rebuilt our [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com) applet to match our new design language &ndash; it even has its own titleTags! We now show a short blurb as well as a headline, so you get even more gaming news at a glance.

[See our applet on the Tidbyt Community GitHub page &raquo;](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/criticalchicken)

### Admin improvements

![A screenshot showing the V2 pop-out menu in our WordPress Dashboard, and our "Adminnouncements" box, which is alerting a staff member that maintenance mode is enabled.](https://github.com/CriticalChicken/V2/assets/35422415/7b1295a3-a252-4ab7-872f-e8938cc5e7b3)

We&rsquo;ve also made things easier for our writers and admins. Our new V2 menu provides instant access to everyday tasks, while our announcements box makes sure everyone&rsquo;s informed about important goings-on.
